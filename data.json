Instructions on [how to install Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/wiki) are listed on their Github page.\n\nOnce that's installed, just unzip the file called \"Release.zip\" into your Mods folder, and you should be good to go!\n\n(Oh, and this mod isn't compatible with the Incantation mod; it causes some issues with one of our Jokers. I'll try to fix that in the future, but for right now, if you have both, it won't work.)\n\nEnjoy!\n",
