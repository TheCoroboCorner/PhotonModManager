Instructions on [how to install Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/wiki) are listed on their Github page.\n\nOnce that's installed, just unzip the file called \"Release.zip\" into your Mods folder, and you should be good to go!\n\n(Oh, and this mod isn't compatible with the Incantation mod; it causes some issues with one of our Jokers. I'll try to fix that in the future, but for right now, if you have both, it won't work.)\n\nEnjoy!\n",

    "readme": "# Balatest - Unit Testing for Balatro\n\nBalatest is a unit testing framework for Balatro mods. See [Bakery's unit tests](https://github.com/BakersDozenBagels/BalatroBakery/tree/main/test) for example code using Balatest.\n\n## How To Use\n\nFirst, register some unit tests with `Balatest.TestPlay` (see below). Then, to run tests, execute `Balatest.run_tests()` (I recommend using [DebugPlus](https://github.com/WilsontheWolf/DebugPlus) to do so). Balatest will put test results in the console/log. You can also only run the tests from a given mod (`Balatest.run_tests 'Bakery'`) or from a category in a mod (`Balatest.run_tests('Bakery', 'blinds')`).\n\n## Writing Tests\n\nA test in Balatest is fundamentally a [challenge](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/wiki/SMODS.Challenge). Many of the keys in a challenge will also work in a test. Balatest will automatically begin the challenge and navigate to the Small Blind (note that every blind is Small by default). From there, `test.execute()` is called, where you will play, discard, navigate rounds, etc. Finally, `test.assert()` is called to evaluate the results of the test.\n\n### `execute`\n\nHere you will put some actions in a queue to set up the test. Note that this queue is *not* the default one; use `Balatest.q()` to add to it (`q` accepts bare functions as well as `Event`s for added convenience. Additionally, it will automatically `return true` for you unless you explicitly `return false`).\n\nBalatest also provides some pre-built events for you (each of these adds to the queue for you):\n- `Balatest.next_round()` ends the round and navigates to the next one.\n- `Balatest.end_round()` ends the round and waits on the evaluation screen.\n- `Balatest.cash_out()` cashes out the round evaluation screen.\n- `Balatest.exit_shop()` exits the shop.\n- `Balatest.start_round()` selects the next blind.\n- `Balatest.skip_blind(for_tag)` skips the next blind for the given tag (by key).\n- `Balatest.play_hand { '2S', '10H' }` plays those cards in that order. Note that this fails if the cards are not in hand.\n- `Balatest.discard { 'Ts', 'Qc' }` discards those cards. Note that this fails if the cards are not in hand.\n- `Balatest.highlight { '2S', '10H' }` highlights those cards in that order. Note that this fails if the cards are not in hand.\n- `Balatest.unhighlight_all()` unhighlights the hand.\n- `Balatest.use(card, instant)` uses a consumable. E.g. `Balatest.use(G.consumeables.cards[1])` (you can also pass a function as in `buy`)\n- `Balatest.buy(func)` buys something from the shop. E.g. `Balatest.buy(function() return G.shop_jokers.cards[1] end)`\n- `Balatest.hook(obj, name, func)` hooks a function until the test concludes. See below for more information.\n- `Balatest.hook_raw(obj, name, new)` overwrites an object until the test concludes.\n- `Balatest.wait_for_input(state, front)` waits until the game will accept input.\n- `Balatest.reload()` saves and loads the game as if by returning to the main menu.\n- `Balatest.wait()` waits until everything currently in the standard event queue completes.\n\n### `assert`\n\nHere you will write some assertions on the final state of the test. Balatest provides a few helpers for this:\n- `Balatest.assert(bool, message?)` is a bare assertion.\n- `Balatest.assert_eq(a, b, message?)` asserts that two numbers are equal with or without Talisman.\n- `Balatest.assert_neq(a, b, message?)` asserts that two numbers are unequal with or without Talisman.\n- `Balatest.assert_chips(num, message?)` asserts that `G.GAME.chips` is equal to the supplied number.\n\n## Example Test\n\n```lua\nBalatest.TestPlay {\n    jokers = { 'j_joker' }, -- Start with a Joker\n    execute = function()\n        Balatest.play_hand { '2S' } -- Play a High Card\n    end,\n    assert = function()\n        Balatest.assert_chips(35) -- Total round score, *not* the last hand\n    end\n}\n```\n\n## Default Values\n\nBalatest will run each test with the following defaults:\n- `back = 'Red Deck'`\n- `stake = 1`\n- `seed = nil`\n- `jokers = {}`\n- `consumeables = {}`\n- `vouchers = {}`\n- `dollars = 0` (Starting money)\n- `discards = 999`\n- `hands = 999`\n- `hand_size = 52`\n- `modifiers = {}` (`challenge.rules.modifiers`)\n- `custom = {}` (`challenge.rules.custom`)\n- `deck = nil`\n- `blind = 'bl_small'`\n- `no_auto_start = false`\n\n# Advanced Features\n\n- Specify `blind = 'bl_wheel'` to make every blind The Wheel. By default, every blind is a Small Blind.\n- Specify `name = 'something'` to give your test a descriptive name. Names are automatically prefixed with your mod's ID.\n- Specify `category = 'my_category'` to be able to run a subset of your tests. You can specify multiple categories in a table.\n- Use `Balatest.run_test { ... }` to run a single test not defined elsewhere.\n- Use `Balatest.run_test 'mod_id_test_name'` to run a single test.\n- Check `Balatest.current_test` for the name of the currently running test.\n- Check `Balatest.current_test_object` for the whole config of the currently running test.\n- Inspect `Balatest.done` for more detailed results of your tests.\n\n## `Balatest.hook`\n\nSometimes it's necessary to hook a function in the middle of a test, for example to control RNG.\nBalatest provides a fixture to do this and automatically unhook the functions later.\n\nConsider the following quite silly test:\n\n```lua\nBalatest.run_test {\n    consumeables = { 'c_judgement' },\n    execute = function()\n        Balatest.hook(_G, 'create_card', function(orig, t, a, l, r, k, s, forced_key, ...)\n            return orig(t, a, l, r, k, s, 'j_chicot', ...)\n        end)\n        Balatest.use(G.consumeables.cards[1])\n    end,\n    assert = function()\n        Balatest.assert_eq(#G.consumeables.cards, 0)\n        Balatest.assert_eq(#G.jokers.cards, 1)\n        Balatest.assert(G.jokers.cards[1].config.center.key == 'j_chicot')\n    end\n}\n```\n\nHere, we force the global function `create_card` to create a Chicot (which otherwise cannot spawn from Judgement).\nNote that the first argument to the new function is the previous function.\n\n```lua\nBalatest.run_test {\n    consumeables = { 'c_judgement', 'c_judgement' },\n    execute = function()\n        Balatest.hook(_G, 'create_card', function(orig, t, a, l, r, k, s, forced_key, ...)\n            return orig(t, a, l, r, k, s, 'j_perkeo', ...)\n        end)\n        Balatest.use(G.consumeables.cards[1])\n        Balatest.hook(_G, 'create_card', function(orig, t, a, l, r, k, s, forced_key, ...)\n            return orig(t, a, l, r, k, s, 'j_caino', ...)\n        end)\n        Balatest.use(G.consumeables.cards[2]) -- The card is looked up before the other one gets destroyed.\n    end,\n    assert = function()\n        Balatest.assert_eq(#G.consumeables.cards, 0)\n        Balatest.assert_eq(#G.jokers.cards, 2)\n        Balatest.assert(G.jokers.cards[1].config.center.key == 'j_perkeo')\n        Balatest.assert(G.jokers.cards[2].config.center.key == 'j_caino')\n    end\n}\n```\n\nHere, we hook the same function twice. Note that when the second hook is applied, the first hook gets removed.\nAlso note that the application of the hook is queued.\nAfter running these tests, even if they fail, the function will be what it was originally.\n"

These blinds are generally more difficult to take down compared to the other blinds, \nwith **Dawn Ordeals** being the easiest, and **Midnight Ordeals** being much a lot tougher to overcome.\n\n## Challenges\nIn some Challenges, Ordeals are guaranteed to appear. In others, you might be fighting **[[[INFORMATION REDACTED]]]**. \nGood luck, Manager. You will need it.\n\n<details>\n    <summary><b>Lobotomy Corporation Spoilers</b></summary>\n    There are challenges that mirror the Sephirah Meltdowns experienced in the main game. \n    It is recommended that they should be experienced in the actual game before attempting them here.\n</details><br>\n\n# Requirements\nRequires the latest version of **Steamodded** 1.0.0-ALPHA.  \nInstructions can be found [here](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/wiki).\n\n# Installation\nHead to the mod's *[Releases](https://github.com/Mysthaps/LobotomyCorp/releases/latest)* page and download the latest version.  \nYou can also *clone* this repository, however, some things may break. \nMake sure that the mod folder is not nested (your folder is **not** ``Mods\\LobotomyCorp\\LobotomyCorp\\...`` or similar). \n \nPlease check the mod's configurations after installation. \n\n# Credits\n### **[Lobotomy Corporation](https://store.steampowered.com/app/568220/Lobotomy_Corporation__Monster_Management_Simulation/)**\n### **[Library of Ruina](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1256670/Library_Of_Ruina/)**\n### **[Limbus Company](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1973530/Limbus_Company/)** \n\nAll music used are listed in the ``music.txt`` file, found [here](https://github.com/Mysthaps/LobotomyCorp/blob/main/music.txt).\nOther credits can be found in the **Credits** tab in the mod's menu"

As a result, there should be few crashes due to conflicts with other mods.\n\n## Recommended Mods\n### Partner by baimao  \npi_cubed's Jokers adds 4 new Partners!  \nhttps://github.com/Icecanno/Partner-API  \n\n### Opandora's Box by opan \nA Joker pack I really enjoy with some interesting synergies, and stellar music.  \nhttps://github.com/ohpahn/opandoras-box\n\n### Extra Credit by CampfireCollective & more  \nhttps://github.com/GuilloryCraft/ExtraCredit\n\n### Neato Jokers by NEATO  \nhttps://github.com/neatoqueen/NeatoJokers\n\n### Paperback by PaperMoon, OppositeWolf770, srockw, GitNether, Victin, BBBalatroMod, & more  \nThe Bisexual Flag Joker is compatible with additional suits.  \nhttps://github.com/GitNether/paperback\n\n### Cryptid by MathIsFun_ & many more  \nThere's some hidden content that requires Cryptid. In addition, I've put a big focus on making sure the changing value mechanics and Misprintize behave properly with all Jokers!  \nhttps://github.com/SpectralPack/Cryptid\n\n## Config Options\nA game restart is required for Config options to take effect.\n\n### New Spectral Cards  \nThis option enables or disables the Spectral Cards Commander, Rupture, and Extinction from appearing.\n\n### Preorder Bonus' Hook  \nTurn this option off to rework the Joker's mechanics very slightly to remove its hook that I (very jankily) implemented. This option may be useful if you're experiencing conflicts regarding setting the cost of Booster Packs.\n\n### Custom Sound Effects  \nEnables or disables any custom sound effects I've implemented into the mod. Currently, this affects Rhythmic Joker, Explosher, On-beat, Off-beat, Pot, and Talking Flower.\n"

    "readme": "# Too Many Jokers\r\nAdds a toggleable sidebar displaying your collection, along with a searchbar.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nPress T to open TMJ on your left.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom is a text input for searching. Searches are loosely matched against every card. If a card doesn't match your search terms, it won't be displayed.\r\n\r\nYou can use multiple search terms using commas. All provided search terms must match with a card for the card to show. (e.g. `+mult, xmult` will only show jokers that give both xmult and +mult, not any joker that gives either)\r\n\r\n## Advanced uses\r\n\r\nThere are several special search terms, surrounded by braces (`{}`). These allow you to specify more about your search. They MUST come before any normal search terms.\r\n\r\n## `{any}`\r\n\r\n{any} specifies that if ANY of the search terms are matched, a card will show up. Using the example above, `{any}, +mult, xmult` will show jokers that give either +mult or xmult.\r\n\r\n## `{regex}`\r\n\r\n{regex} specifies that we should use Lua's pattern matcher instead of just a raw search. Keep in mind this is Lua patterns, not actual regex.\r\n\r\n## `{edition:modprefix_editionkey}`\r\n\r\n{edition} will apply the specified edition to all cards in TMJ. This is useful for mod developers making shaders that want to see how their shader looks on various (or specific) jokers.\r\n\r\n## `{ace:<lua code here>}`\r\n\r\n{ace} will run the lua code as the block of a function (or just a single expression e.g. `center.pools.Kitties`, or in the case of a full function body `if center.pools.Kitties then return true end`) given the argument of `center`. If it returns `false`, `nil`, or errors (which will be caught), then the center passed into the function will not show in TMJ.\r\n\r\nIt is okay for the function given to error, it will be treated as if the function returned false.\r\n\r\nThis is helpful for... uh.... uhm.... idk but it's cool right?\r\n\r\n## `!`\r\nAny non-special search term can be prefixed with `!` to specify that you want to negate that search term (so if it IS matched, do not show the card)\r\n\r\nCredits to Dimserene for the idea to create this mod.\r\n\r\n",

Exclusions are in place for the T key (to close the UI) and special keys like control, alt, shift\r\n- Better performance, so TMJ should be much faster with thousands of jokers (as the name would suggest)\r\n- Code in general is much cleaner, so future improvements will be much easier",

This can be used for things such as currency conversion. That is, if your mod adds a set of currencies that have some sort of an exchange rate, you can implement that exchange rate in this system and avoid all of the trouble that comes with doing that.\r\n\r\nWith the event manager, you no longer need to create dummy CardAreas and dummy Jokers just to be able to activate functions in a specific context; you can just set up an event and let the event manager handle it all. In addition, it supports prioritization, as well as single-use/persistent events, so it should have maximum versatility in the areas it's needed.\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/TheCoroboCorner/CoroboUtils/compare/v1.0.0...v1.1.0",

        "body": "There are four main functions/systems provided in this release:\r\n\r\n1. You can create aliases for functions and variables. You simply register an alias in the system with `CUTIL.alias`, then you can either access the aliased function directly with `CUTIL.aliases`, or you can use `CUTIL.resolve_alias` to fetch it in a safer manner.\r\n2. There is a variable/modifier system. Instead of having to register all your game variables directly in G.GAME, you can now just call `CUTIL.add_variable` and it will sort out everything for you. Similarly, for when you want to modify the variable, you can now just call `CUTIL.add_modifier`, targeting the specific variable and modifying it however you wish.\r\n3. You can work with numeric field extensions -- that is, take for example you wanted to work with the complex numbers. You can then use `CUTIL.FieldExtension.wrap({1, 0, 1}), as that defines x such that 1 + 0x + 1x^2 = 0, which is exactly how i works in the complex numbers.\r\n4. Tweening and Bezier curves have been added. You can either construct a curve explicitly with `CUTIL.Tween.make_bezier` or `CUTIL.Tween.create`, or you can use one of the provided presets. This can be used to make things a lot smoother.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, various miscellaneous functions have been added and documentation is provided in the code.",
