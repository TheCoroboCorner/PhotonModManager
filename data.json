Instructions on [how to install Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/wiki) are listed on their Github page.\n\nOnce that's installed, just unzip the file called \"Release.zip\" into your Mods folder, and you should be good to go!\n\n(Oh, and this mod isn't compatible with the Incantation mod; it causes some issues with one of our Jokers. I'll try to fix that in the future, but for right now, if you have both, it won't work.)\n\nEnjoy!\n",

This should already be installed as part of steamodded's installation process.\n\n# Installation\nGet the latest stable version from the [Releases](https://github.com/larswijn/CardSleeves/releases/latest), then download and extract the zip.\nOr use `git clone` for the latest development code, which is more up-to-date, but might be unstable.\n\nMake sure to put the `CardSleeves` folder in the `Mods` directory, and that it is not nested.\n\n# Features\nSleeves are run modifiers similar to decks. Any deck and sleeve can be combined.\n\nCardSleeves adds 15 Sleeves by default, some of which have an unique and different effect when paired with their corresponding deck:\n| Sleeve           | Base effect                                            | Unique effect                                                          |\n|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Red Sleeve       | +1 discard                                             | +1 discard, -1 hand                                                    |\n| Blue Sleeve      | +1 hand                                                | +1 hand, -1 discard                                                    |\n| Yellow Sleeve    | +$10                                                   | Seed Money Voucher                                                     |\n| Green Sleeve     | +$1 per remaining hand/discard                         | Can go up to -$2 in debt for every hand and discard                    |\n| Black Sleeve     | +1 joker slot, -1 hand                                 | +1 joker slot, -1 discard                                              |\n| Magic Sleeve     | Crystal Ball Voucher, 2 Fools                          | Omen Globe Voucher                                                     |\n| Nebula Sleeve    | Telescope Voucher, -1 consumable slot                  | Observatory Voucher                                                    |\n| Ghost Sleeve     | Spectral cards appear in shop, Hex card                | Spectrals appear more often in shop, Spectral pack size increases by 2 |\n| Abandoned Sleeve | No Face Cards in starting deck                         | Face Cards never appear                                                |\n| Checkered Sleeve | 26 Spades and 26 Hearts in starting deck               | Only Spades and Hearts appear                                          |\n| Zodiac Sleeve    | Tarot Merchant, Planet Merchant and Overstock Vouchers | Arcana/Celestial pack size increases by 2                              |\n| Painted Sleeve   | +2 hand size, -1 joker slot                            | +1 card selection limit, -1 joker slot                                 |\n| Anaglyph Sleeve  | Double Tag after each Boss Blind                       | Double Tag after each Small/Big Blind                                  |\n| Plasma Sleeve    | Balance chips/mult, X2 base Blind size                 | Balance prices in shop                                                 |\n| Erratic Sleeve   | All ranks/suits in starting deck are randomized        | Starting Hands/Discards/Dollars/Joker slots are randomized between 3-6 |\n\nOther mods have the ability to add their own Sleeves!
