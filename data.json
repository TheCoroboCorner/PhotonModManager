Instructions on [how to install Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/wiki) are listed on their Github page.\n\nOnce that's installed, just unzip the file called \"Release.zip\" into your Mods folder, and you should be good to go!\n\n(Oh, and this mod isn't compatible with the Incantation mod; it causes some issues with one of our Jokers. I'll try to fix that in the future, but for right now, if you have both, it won't work.)\n\nEnjoy!\n",

If you've downloaded the source code from GitHub (by clicking on [Code] and then [Download ZIP]), the folder within the ZIP may be called `Talisman-main`, which will cause a problem. Simply rename the folder(s) so that the `-main` part of the name is removed, so that the folder is just called `Talisman`.\nWhenever you are manually updating Talisman or Cryptid, or any other mod for that matter, it's a good approach to instead delete the contents of the folder, then install the contents of the folder from the ZIP into the existing folder to avoid having to constantly rename the folder over and over.\nFor automatic updates, try using the [automatic update script](https://discord.com/channels/1264429948970733782/1268911536638787625).\nIt could also be that Steamodded is out of date, sometimes mods may use features of a new version that's absent in an older version, but don't change the version that they ask for.\nYou can grab the latest Steamodded by [clicking here](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).\n\n> *I can't see any new jokers/content!*\n\nIf you've installed everything correctly, but no new jokers, blinds, etc. are ingame, check the Mods list by clicking on [MODS] in the main menu, and look for Cryptid/Talisman.\nIf they show up red, that means there's a problem. Hover over the mod icon (which should be an exclamation mark) to see what said problem is. It could be an outdated dependency in most cases.\n\n> *What's up with all the \"M\" jokers/references to Jolly Joker?*\n\n\"M\" is a reference to an incident in the official Balatro Discord where a user named mjiojio was spamming the letter \"m\" in various channels. When asked what their least favourite joker was, they answered with Jolly Joker, and that's how the \"M\" joke became a thing!\n\n> *There's some content in the mod I don't like! Is there any way to remove them?*\n\nYou can disable some features of the mod by opening your Mods, clicking [Cryptid], going over to the Config tab, and clicking Thematic Sets. There, you can toggle various Cryptid additions on or off as you see fit.\nYou can also enable/disable certain music tracks in the Music tab. If you're a streamer, consider disabling the Jimball music for your safety!\n\n> *I'm hitting infinity very often, is there any way to raise the limit of the scoring system?*\n\nTalisman may be configured to be on **BigNum** mode, which has a maximum limit of ee308. You can make the limit virtually disappear by changing it to **OmegaNum**, which can handle e10##1000. You can configure it by going into Mods, then clicking Talisman, and changing the Score Limit under Config. Be careful; if you have a saved run that was on a different number system, you won't be able to load it (unless if you switch back)!\n\n\n> *I've experienced a crash/bug!*\n\nBe sure to give us as much information about the bug/crash as possible. A way to reproduce the bug/crash is also especially useful information to help us fix it.\nRemember; just saying you're crashing doesn't tell us anything. We need to know the details!\n",
