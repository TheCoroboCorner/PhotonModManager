              Proton Mod Manager is a website meant to host Balatro mods online for people to share. It's a rather basic site, as it's more meant as an efficient way to store mod data for a future in-game manager, but generally, it should hold up very well.

            <h3>
              How to Access Mod Data
            </h3>
            <p>
              The way to access the raw data for your uses is just by accessing the <a href="https://photonmodmanager.onrender.com/data" target="_blank">/data subdomain</a>. There, all the relevant data is stored in a .json file, such as id, name, author(s), description, dependencies, etc. Everything is stored except the latest version or the list of releases/release info, which would quickly get outdated and is better to fetch directly from GitHub when needed.
            </p>

            <h3>
              Favourites
            </h3>
            <p>
              What are "favourites"? Well, they are our site's like system. You can like posts that you approve of to bring them up the rankings.

              Support Me
            </h3>
            <p>
              If you want to support my work, the best way to do so is on <a href="https://ko-fi.com/thecorobocorner" target="_blank">Ko-Fi</a>, though even just giving all the feedback you can helps a considerable amount and lets me improve my work for everyone to see. I try to be as receptive to feedback as I can, so just send me something on any of my social media platforms and I'll try to respond.
