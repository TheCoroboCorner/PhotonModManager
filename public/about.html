              Proton Mod Manager is a website (and soon-to-be in-game manager) meant to host Balatro mods online for people to share. It's a rather basic site, as it's more meant as an efficient way to store mod data for a future in-game manager, but generally, it should hold up very well.

            <h3>
              How to Access Mod Data
            </h3>
            <p>
              The way to access the raw data for your uses is just by accessing the <a href="https://photonmodmanager.onrender.com/data" target="_blank">/data subdomain</a>. There, all the relevant data is stored in a .json file, such as id, name, author(s), description, dependencies, etc. Everything is stored except the latest version or the list of releases/release info, which would quickly get outdated and is better to fetch directly from GitHub when needed.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>
              Favourites
            </h3>
            <p>
              What are "favourites"? Currently, they are unimplemented, though when we implement the in-game version, we will have an implemented like system on both platforms, with each person being able to like whatever projects they wish, and rise to the top of the ranking. It may be implemented sooner, depending on how long it takes to implement the in-game version, so please wait until then.
            </p>

              Support Me
            </h3>
            <p>
              If you want to support my work, the best way to do so is on <a href="https://ko-fi.com/thecorobocorner" target="_blank">Ko-Fi</a>, though even just giving all the feedback you can helps a considerable amount and lets me improve my work for everyone to see. I try to be as receptive to feedback as I can, so just send me something on any of my social media platforms and I'll try to respond.
