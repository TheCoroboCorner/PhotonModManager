              Photon Mod Manager is a mod manager for Balatro meant for efficient implementation and optimized usage. It is intended to allow for quick and easy access to its selection of mods via web requests, allowing for as little web bloat as possible. It is an attempt to optimize the storage aspect of Balatro mods by using Github's API to lessen the load on the server itself, while still allowing for quick and easy storage.
